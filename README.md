I have a lot of different leds in my drawer, some are new high efficiency devices, other are pretty old and despite a high amount of current (say 10 mA) are less brighter than the new ones (at 1 mA). I still have some leds from the 80-90s but their max brightness is incredibly low: practically unusable.
I sometimes need to put together leds having different colors and to get uniform brightness I need to test the leds together and experimentally find acceptable R values.
Similar problems with analog (4 pins) RGB leds.<br>
